    <h3>FMCSA/DoT Requirements and Beyond</h3>
    <p>Navigating all the rules and regulations under the Department of Transportation and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations can be time-consuming. There is a lot of documentation and monitoring required, even if it’s just for a 1-ton truck. Here are some requirements you need to know.</p>

    <h3>Driver Qualification</h3>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, if you are going to employ drivers to carry interstate and intrastate loads, they require driver qualification files, which include information such as driving history, employment history, road test certificate, certificate of violations, and a three-year inquiry to state agencies. That’s in addition to meeting the general driving credentials. Driver qualification logs must be updated annually. DoT also requires drug and alcohol testing in certain circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Truck ELD Requirements for Drivers Logs/ELogs for Truck Drivers</h3>
    <p>As of December 2019, the FMCSA truck ELD requirements took effect. Carriers must monitor compliance with the daily Hours of Service mandate using an ELD (electronic logging device that creates electronic logs for truck drivers) connected to the truck engine. You also need to conduct monthly recaps of drivers logs and reports in order to take corrective action if there is non-compliant behavior. The elogs for truck drivers are an easy target for DoT inspectors and auditors, so it is imperative to ensure that you get this right.</p>

    <h3>Other Requirements</h3>
    <p>Of course, the DoT/FMCSA also allows roadside safety and state mileage audits and inspections. Additionally, you can have IRP and IFTA audits. That’s a lot to be on top of — so why not let Hawkeye Freights & Dispatch worry about that?</p>


    <h3>Choosing a DOT Compliance Service</h3>
    <p>here is very little room to maneuver when it comes to compliance. The trucking industry is regulated carefully and precisely, and this is done for good reason — to protect the rights of drivers and of clients and to ensure the safety of everyone on the road. This makes staying compliant critical for all drivers and owner-operators. It also means that there is no margin for error.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, it makes sense to choose a DOT compliance service that can help you secure compliance without the hassle. As a truck driver, you already have a lot on your mind when it comes to running your business and providing your services to your clients in the right way. Letting a trusted partner take care of your compliance can make the other aspects of operation much easier.</p>
    <p>Take a look at some of the benefits of working with a trusted DOT compliance partner.</p>

    <p><strong>Peace of mind when handling electronic logs for truck drivers</strong></p>
    <p>Drivers logs now need to be fully digitized. This means, your drivers’ daily logs and all other regular logging and reporting need to be handled by a truck ELD. This makes life easier for truck drivers, but it also adds an element of anxiety. These electronic drivers logs need to be properly managed and maintained, and failing to do this can result in non-compliance and a hefty fine.</p>
    <p>The right service provider will manage these elogs for truck drivers so you don’t have to worry about it. This way, you can appreciate the benefits of electronic logs for drivers without experiencing any of the hassles and difficulties that can come with this.</p>

    <p><strong>Protect your business’s revenue</strong></p>
    <p>ELD truck requirements and other compliance regulations are enforced by government agencies and authorities. This means you could be facing a fine if you are found to be operating outside the compliance rules and regulations. Making sure your truck elogs are up to date, and ensuring that your business adheres fully to all safety regulations, helps you avoid any such penalties.</p>

    <p><strong>Grow your business with confidence</strong></p>
    <p>You are focused on achieving great results for your clients right here and right now, but you are also thinking about the future. You need to be able to grow your business and expand what you provide to your customers, and you need to be able to do all of this with confidence. </p>
    <p>Perhaps you want to add larger vehicles to your business fleet — and get an ELD for one ton truck, for example. Or, you simply want to make sure that all of your commercial vehicles and trucks are on the ELD system. Maybe you want to ensure that all of your vehicles and your operations are fully compliant with safety regulation, even at scale. The right service provider will be able to achieve this for you.</p>

    <p><strong>Focus on running your business in the right way</strong></p>
    <p>You love to drive, and you love to serve your clients wherever they are found. You might not love logging your driver activity or meticulously checking each and every aspect of compliance regulation to make sure you are in adherence.</p>
    <p>This is why DOT compliance services are so useful to truck drivers and owner-operators. With these services, drivers can focus on doing what they do best — driving and going above and beyond client expectations.</p>
