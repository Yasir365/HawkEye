    <h3>Documents service dispatch: mandatory paperwork</h3>
    <p>Commercial truck drivers need to know more than how to operate their rig and follow state and federal safety guidelines. Completing paperwork is a significant part of the job. Failure to complete and file all your mandatory documentation can cause problems. For instance, receipts for all expenses during a trip must be attached to trip sheets. Whether you work for a carrier that will reimburse you directly for the expenses or file them on your annual tax return, you must have documentation that meets the conditions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Our documents service dispatch can help. </p>
    <p>Here is a breakdown of some of the other required documents for which truck drivers are responsible:</p>
    
    <div class="tick"> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Customs paperwork</strong> </div>
    <p>This is necessary for truckers with routes that cross the border from the U.S. into Canada or Mexico.</p>

    <div class="tick"> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Trip sheets. </strong> </div>
    <p>Every company has them, and they must be completed accurately if you want to get paid.</p>
    
    <div class="tick"> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Accident/incident reports. </strong> </div>
    <p>Whether you have damaged freight or were involved in a crash, most carriers require a detailed report for their records and to ensure compliance with DOT regulations.</p>
    
    <h3>Mandated DOT documentation</h3>
    <p>Every truck driver carries a document folder in their rig. Inspections can go south in a hurry when truck drivers are missing required DOT documentation.
