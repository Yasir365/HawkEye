    <h3 class="mt-3">Trucking Document Dispatch Services</h3>
    <p>Document dispatch services understand that hauling products from point A to point B is not the end of the day for truck drivers. Truck drivers are faced with hours of administrative paperwork long after their route is complete. Stringent requirements for paperwork must be met to stay in compliance with safety and U.S. Department of Transportation regulations. Insurance documents, log sheets, trip sheets, bills of lading, and accident/incident reports are just the tip of the paperwork iceberg. With all this paperwork facing them, truck drivers can feel overwhelmed. Document dispatch services can help.</p>

    <h3>Choose Your Truck Type</h3>

    <h3>Documents service dispatch: mandatory paperwork</h3>
    <p>Commercial truck drivers need to know more than how to operate their rig and follow state and federal safety guidelines. Completing paperwork is a significant part of the job. Failure to complete and file all your mandatory documentation can cause problems. For instance, receipts for all expenses during a trip must be attached to trip sheets. Whether you work for a carrier that will reimburse you directly for the expenses or file them on your annual tax return, you must have documentation that meets the conditions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Our documents service dispatch can help. </p>
    <p>Here is a breakdown of some of the other required documents for which truck drivers are responsible:</p>
    
    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Customs paperwork</strong> </div>
    <p>This is necessary for truckers with routes that cross the border from the U.S. into Canada or Mexico.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Trip sheets. </strong> </div>
    <p>Every company has them, and they must be completed accurately if you want to get paid.</p>
    
    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Accident/incident reports. </strong> </div>
    <p>Whether you have damaged freight or were involved in a crash, most carriers require a detailed report for their records and to ensure compliance with DOT regulations.</p>
    
    <h3>Mandated DOT documentation</h3>
    <p>Every truck driver carries a document folder in their rig. Inspections can go south in a hurry when truck drivers are missing required DOT documentation. As part of our documents service dispatch, we ensure truck drivers are never caught unprepared. Here is what we help you keep updated:</p>
    
    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Authority documents </strong> </div>
    <p>that authorize owner-operators or drivers for carriers to transport freight. It must include your company name and motor carrier number.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Certificate of insurance </strong> </div>
    <p>lists your insurance provider and policy numbers, plus contact information for your insurance agent.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Truck registration  </strong> </div>
    <p>documentation that includes your truck’s VIN, license plate number, and make/model. Information on the rig’s registered owner also is required.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Annual inspection  </strong> </div>
    <p>paperwork that verifies a truck driver’s rig is operational and free of defects. Having the inspection sticker on the side of your truck is not enough. You need the supporting documentation in your official files.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>	Lease agreements  </strong> </div>
    <p>are required for owner-operators and drivers who are operating a vehicle that is not registered under their names.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA)  </strong> </div>
    <p>stickers and cab cards showing annual updates, company information, and expiration dates.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Electronic logging device (ELD) instructions  </strong> </div>
    <p> must be inside your truck and presented during any roadside safety inspections.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Backup paper logs </strong> </div>
    <p>are required, even for truck drivers who use ELDs. DOT regulations state truck drivers must keep the equivalent of a week’s worth of driver logs.</p>

    <div> <i class="fa-solid fa-check text-danger"></i> <strong>Hazmat permits </strong> </div>
    <p>for both individual states and federal licensing requirements for truck drivers who transport hazardous materials.</p>
