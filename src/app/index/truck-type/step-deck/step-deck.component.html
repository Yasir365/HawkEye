      <p>It’s “go big or go home” when it comes to hauling using step deck (also known as “drop deck”) trailers. Transporting oversize and over-height freight is a major responsibility, not to mention needing to navigate organizational and logistical minefields to keep your firm solvent.</p>
      <p>If you spend a significant portion of your day looking for and evaluating potential step deck loads, haggling over prices and step deck freight rates, generating and completing all the paperwork required by regulations and industry practices, monitoring for and ensuring compliance with all relevant legislation and sector guidelines, you won’t be able to focus on getting these large step-deck or flatbed available loads where they need to be safely and on time. That’s where Hawkeye Freights & Dispatch comes in.</p>
